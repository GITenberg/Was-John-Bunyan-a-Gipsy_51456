3</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> title-page of this little
publication states that it is &ldquo;particularly addressed to
the students of the universities.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is based on a
History of the Gipsies, published in 1865, in a prefatory note to
which it was said that this subject,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When thus comprehensively treated, forms a
study for the most advanced and cultivated mind, as well as for
the youth whose intellectual and literary character is still to
be formed; and furnishes, among other things, a system of science
not too abstract in its nature, and having for its subject-matter
the strongest of human feelings and sympathies.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This race entered Great Britain before the year 1506, and
sooner or later became legally and socially proscribed.&nbsp; It
has been my endeavour for some years back to have the
<i>social</i> proscription removed (the <i>legal</i> one having
ceased to exist), so that at least the <i>name</i> and
<i>blood</i> of this people should be acknowledged by the rest of
the world, and each member of the race as such treated according
to his personal merits.&nbsp; The great difficulty I have
encountered in this matter is the general impression that this
race is confined to a few wandering people of swarthy appearance,
who live in tents, or are popularly known as Gipsies; and that
these &ldquo;cease to be Gipsies&rdquo; when they in any way
&ldquo;fall into the ranks,&rdquo; and dress and live, more or
less, like other people.&nbsp; Unfortunately many have so
publicly committed themselves to this view of the subject that it
is hardly possible to get them to revise their opinion, and admit
the leading fact of the question, viz.: that the Gipsies do not
&ldquo;cease to be Gipsies&rdquo; by any change in their style of
life or character, and that the same holds good with their
descendants.&nbsp; Taking the race or blood in itself, and
especially when mixed with native, it has every reason to call
itself, in one sense at least, English, from having been nearly
four hundred years in England.&nbsp; The race has been a very
hardy and prolific one, and (with the exception of a few
families, about which there it no certainty) has got very much
mixed with native blood, which so greatly modified the appearance
of that part of it that it was enabled to <i>steal</i> into
society, and escape the observation of the native race, and their
prejudice against everything Gipsy, so far as they understood the
subject.</p>
<p>It is a long stretch for a native family to trace its descent
to people living in the time of Henry VIII., but a very short one
for a semi-barbarous tribe as such, having so singular an origin
as a <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>tent,
as applicable to all descending from it, however much part of
their blood may be of the ordinary race; the origin of which is
generally unknown to them.&nbsp; Thus they have no other sense of
origin than a Gipsy one, and that &ldquo;theirs is a Gipsy
family,&rdquo; of an arrival in England like that of yesterday,
with words and signs, and a cast of mind peculiar to themselves,
leading, by their associations and sympathies of race, to them
generally, if not almost invariably, marrying among themselves,
and perpetuating the race, as something distinct from the rest of
the world, and scattered over its surface, in various stages of
civilization and purity of blood.</p>
<p>Leaving out the tented or more primitive Gipsies, there is
hardly anything about this people, when their blood has been
mixed and their habits changed, to attract the <i>eye</i> of the
world; hence it becomes the subject of a <i>mental</i> inquiry,
so far as its <i>nature</i> is concerned.&nbsp; And the human
faculties being so limited in their powers, even when trained
from early youth, it will be, at the best, a difficult matter to
get the subject of the Gipsies understood; while it appears to be
a desperate effort to get people beyond a certain age, or of a
peculiar mind or training, to make anything of it, or even to
listen to the mention of it, which almost seems to be offensive
to them.&nbsp; On this account, if the subject of the Gipsy race,
in all its mixtures of blood and aspects of meaning, can ever
become one of interest, or even known, to the rest of the human
family, it must be taken up, for the most part, by young people
whose minds are open to receive information, as illustrated by
what I wrote in connexion with Scotch university
students:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;At their time of life they are more easily
impressed with the truth of what can be demonstrated, than after
having acquired modes of thought and feeling in regard to it,
which have to be modified or got rid of, after more or less
trouble and sometimes pain.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This subject does not in any way clash with what is generally
held in dispute among men, but touches many traits of their
common humanity.&nbsp; Its investigation illustrates the laws of
evidence on whatever subject to which evidence may be
applicable&mdash;that all questions should be settled by facts,
and not by suppositions; and that no one has a right to maintain
capriciously that anything is a truth until it is proved to be an
untruth.&nbsp; As regards John Bunyan, it is not in dispute that
he was an English <i>man</i>, but whether he was of the
<i>native</i> English race, or of the <i>Gipsy</i> English one,
or of both, and holding by the Gipsy connexion.&nbsp; What is
necessary to be done is not merely to correct, but to create, and
permanently establish a knowledge that has now no existence with
people generally, in consequence of the habits of the original
Gipsies leading to their legal and social proscription, and the
naturally secretive nature of the race, which has been
intensified by the way in which they were everywhere treated or
regarded.</p>
<p>Apart from this subject in itself, it may be said to be one of
those side questions which it is always advisable for a student
to have <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>on
hand, as a mental relief after severe studies, and to liberalize
or expand his mind generally.</p>
<p>The question of John Bunyan having been of the Gipsy race,
discussed in the following pages, is merely an incidental part of
the subject of the Gipsies.&nbsp; What I have said there about
the Rev. John Brown, of Bedford, makes it unnecessary for me to
add much here, except to say that, as he has no standing in the
discussion of the Gipsy question as applicable to Bunyan, he
would not be listened to but for his being minister of
Bunyan&rsquo;s Church, and setting forth theories as to his
nationality that meet the preconceived opinions and ardent wishes
of others.&nbsp; His discovery of Bunyan&rsquo;s descent is of
great interest; but for it to be of any use, he should have taken
it to such as were able to interpret it, instead of proclaiming
that he had thereby done away with the idea of Bunyan having been
of the Gipsy race, to the apparent welcome of those who will have
it so.&nbsp; He had previously &ldquo;done away with&rdquo; the
same idea by discovering that the name of Bunyan existed in
England before the Gipsies arrived in it!&nbsp; As the occupant
of Bunyan&rsquo;s pulpit, it was clearly his sacred duty to
carefully scrutinize the information left by Bunyan as to
&ldquo;what he said he was and was not, and his calling and
surroundings,&rdquo; for these exclusively constitute the
question at issue, and as carefully study everything bearing on
the subject.&nbsp; Had he done so, he would have found that the
family of the illustrious dreamer did not enter England from
Normandy with William the Conqueror (whatever might have been the
blood of William and Thomas Bonyon in 1542), or were native
English vagabonds, as some have thought, but Gipsies whose blood
was mixed; so that John Bunyan doubtless spoke the language of
the race in great purity, and was capable, after a little effort,
to have written it.&nbsp; In England to-day there are many such
men as Bunyan, barring his piety and genius, following his
original calling, that speak the Gipsy language with more or less
purity, saying nothing of others in much higher positions in
life.&nbsp; Of the former especially I have met and conversed in
America with a number, who had no doubt of John Bunyan having
been one of their race.</p>
<p>Whatever the future may bring forth, I have no reason to
change what I wrote in <i>Contributions to Natural History</i>,
<i>etc.</i>, in 1871, in regard to the only bar in the way of
receiving Bunyan as a Gipsy being the prejudice of caste against
the name:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Even in the United States I find
intelligent and liberal-minded Scotchmen, twenty years absent
from their native country, saying, &lsquo;I would <i>not like</i>
it to be said,&rsquo; and others, &lsquo;I would <i>not have</i>
it said,&rsquo; that Bunyan was a Gipsy&rdquo; (p. 158).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This feeling cannot be changed in a day, however involuntary
it frequently is, or however much it may be repudiated in
public.</p>
<p>The Gipsy, whatever his position in life, and however much his
blood may be mixed, is exceedingly proud of the romance of his
descent.&nbsp; The following extracts are taken from the
Disquisition on the Gipsies on that subject:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>&ldquo;He pictures to himself these men [John Faw, Towla
Bailyow, and others, in 1540], as so many swarthy, slashing
heroes, dressed in scarlet and green, armed with pistols and
broad-swords, mounted on blood-horses, with hawks and hounds in
their train.&nbsp; True to nature, every Gipsy is delighted with
his descent, no matter what other people, in their ignorance of
the subject, may think of it, or what their prejudices may be in
regard to it&rdquo; (p. 500).&mdash;&ldquo;If we refer to the
treaty between John Faw and James V., in 1540, we will very
readily conclude that, three centuries ago, the leaders of the
Gipsies were very superior men in their way; cunning, astute, and
slippery Oriental barbarians, with the experience of upwards of a
century in European society generally; well up to the ways of the
world and the general ways of Church and State, and, in a sense,
at home with kings, popes, cardinals, nobility, and gentry.&nbsp;
That was the character of a superior Gipsy in 1540.&nbsp; In 1840
we find the race represented by as fine a man as ever graced the
Church of Scotland&rdquo; (p. 465).&mdash;&ldquo;Scottish Gipsies
are British subjects as much as either Highland or Lowland Scots;
their being of foreign origin does not alter the case; and they
are entitled to have that justice meted out to them that has been
accorded to the ordinary natives.&nbsp; They are not a
heaven-born race, but they certainly found their way into the
country as if they had dropped into it out of the clouds.&nbsp;
As a race, they have that much mystery, originality, and
antiquity about them, and that inextinguishable sensation of
being a branch of the same tribe everywhere, that ought to cover
a multitude of failings connected with their past history.&nbsp;
Indeed, what we do know of their earliest history is not nearly
so barbarous as that of our own; for we must contemplate our own
ancestors at one time as painted and skin-clad barbarians.&nbsp;
What we do know for certainty of the earliest history of the
Scottish Gipsies is contained more particularly in the Act of
1540; and we would naturally say that, for a people in a
barbarous state, such is the dignity and majesty, with all the
roguishness displayed in the conduct of the Gipsies of that
period, one could hardly have a better, certainly not a more
romantic descent; provided the person whose descent it is, is to
be found amid the ranks of Scots, with talents, a character, and
a position equal to those of others around him.&nbsp; For this
reason, it must be said of the race, that whenever it shakes
itself clear of objectionable habits, and follows any kind of
ordinary industry, the cause of every prejudice against it is
gone, or ought to disappear; for then, as I have already said,
the Gipsies become ordinary citizens of the Gipsy clan.&nbsp; It
then follows, that in passing a fair judgment upon the Gipsy
race, we ought to establish a principle of progression, and set
our minds upon the best specimens of it, as well as the worst,
and not judge of it solely from the poorest, the most ignorant,
or the most barbarous part of it&rdquo; (p. 479).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Satisfied with, even proud of, their descent, the Gipsies hide
it from the rest of the world, for reasons that are obvious,
however much I have explained them on previous occasions.&nbsp;
And thus, as I wrote in <i>Contributions to Natural History</i>,
<i>etc.</i>,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It unfortunately happens that, owing to the
peculiarity of their origin, and the prejudice of the rest of the
population, the race hide the fact of their being Gipsies from
the rest of the world, as they acquire settled habits, or even
leave the tent, so that they never get the credit of any good
that may spring from them as a people&rdquo; (158).&nbsp; And
this may have been going on from the time of their arrival in
England.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With reference to this phenomenon, I wrote thus in the
Disquisition on the Gipsies:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Now, since John Bunyan has become so famous
throughout the world, and so honoured by all sects and parties,
what an inimitable instrument Providence has placed in our hands
wherewith to raise up the name of Gipsy!&nbsp; Through him we can
touch the heart of Christendom!&rdquo; (p. 530).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>It would
be a sad thing to have the century close without the Gipsy race
being acknowledged by the rest of the world, in some form or
other, or that that should be deemed unworthy of our boasted
civilization!&nbsp; To get this subject completely before the
British public would resemble the recovery of a lost art, or the
discovery of a new one.&nbsp; People taking it up there would
require to show a high degree of courage, candour, and courtesy,
and all the better qualities of their nature.</p>
<p>On the 8th September I wrote thus to the editor of the
<i>Daily News</i>:&mdash;&ldquo;I intend printing the articles
sent you as the bulk of a pamphlet, . . . so that I am in hopes
you will have previously printed them in the <i>Daily
News</i>,&rdquo; which he does not seem to have done.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">New York</span>, 2d <i>October</i>,
1882.</p>
<h2><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>WAS JOHN
BUNYAN A GIPSY?</h2>
<h3>I. <a name="citation9"></a><a href="#footnote9"
class="citation">[9]</a></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first notice of my pamphlet,
under the title of <i>John Bunyan and the Gipsies</i>, that has
come under my observation I found in the <i>Daily News</i> of the
15th August.&nbsp; In the preface to it I said:&mdash;&ldquo;This
little publication is intended, in the first place, for the
British Press,&rdquo; as an appeal for a hearing on the subjects
discussed in it.&nbsp; The time that elapsed between receiving
the pamphlet and writing the notice of it was too short to enable
almost any one to do justice to it, for that required time to
think over it as having reference to my previous writings, to
which the two letters to an English clergyman contained in it
were merely an allusion.</p>
<p>The writer is hardly correct when he speaks of the &ldquo;long
debated question of whether the illustrious author of the
<i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i> was of Gipsy race.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This question has not been even once &ldquo;debated&rdquo; in
England, so far as I, living in America, am aware of.&nbsp; I
stated it fully in <i>Notes and Queries</i> on the 12th December,
1857, and more fully in the <i>History of the Gipsies</i>,
published by Sampson, Low &amp; Co. in 1865; again in <i>Notes
and Queries</i> on the 27th March, 1875, with reference to the
&ldquo;fairish appearance&rdquo; of Bunyan, and the existence of
his surname (variously spelt) in England before the Gipsies
arrived in it; then in <i>Contributions to Natural History and
Papers on Other Subjects</i>, and <i>The English Universities and
John Bunyan</i>, and <i>The Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica and the
Gipsies</i>; then in <i>The Scottish Churches and the
Gipsies</i>; and, finally, in the pamphlet alluded to.&nbsp; So
that, instead of having &ldquo;nothing to say&rdquo; to the
&ldquo;fairish appearance&rdquo; and the surname of Bunyan, I
fully anticipated these questions, and disposed of them as they
were brought forward by people at a venture, who seemed to know
nothing of the subject they were treating.&nbsp; Much as I have
published on this question, I am not aware that any one has ever
attempted to set aside my facts, arguments, and proof that John
Bunyan was of the Gipsy race.&nbsp; My &ldquo;opponents&rdquo;
(so called) <i>assume</i> that he was of the ordinary English
race, and <i>therefore</i> was, and must be held to have been,
such till it is <i>proved</i> that he was <i>not</i> that, but of
the Gipsy race, or something else; a most unreasonable position
for any one to take up.&nbsp; So far from people stating the kind
of <i>proof</i> they want, they simply pass over everything I
have written on the subject, and repeat their untenable,
meaningless, and oft-refuted assertions.&nbsp; Thus the Rev. John
Brown, of Bunyan Church, Bedford, apparently knowing nothing of
the Gipsy subject, and disregarding everything printed on it, and
looking neither to the right nor the left, makes out from the
surname that the illustrious dreamer&rsquo;s family was a
broken-down branch of the English aristocracy, instead of, as
Bunyan himself told us, &ldquo;the meanest and most despised of
<i>all</i> the families in the land,&rdquo; and &ldquo;not of the
Israelites,&rdquo; that is, <i>not Jews</i>, but tinkers, that
is, Gipsies of more or less mixed blood; so that his having been
a tinker was in itself amply sufficient to prove Bunyan to <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>have been of
the Gipsy race; while it illustrated and confirmed his admission
about &ldquo;his father&rsquo;s house&rdquo; having been of the
Gipsy tribe.</p>
<p>Having written so frequently, and at such length, on this
subject, it would be impossible, at least unreasonable, to repeat
in a newspaper article what I have done, and I must refer the
reader to the various publications mentioned.&nbsp; I may allude
to the scepticism of <i>Blackwood</i>, who will not believe that
Bunyan was of the Gipsy race because he did not say so plainly,
in the face of the legal and social responsibility; <a
name="citation10a"></a><a href="#footnote10a"
class="citation">[10a]</a> and to that of Mr. Groome, the writer
on the Gipsies in the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i>,
because he alluded to a Gipsy woman carrying off a child, and
because his children did not bear the old-fashioned Gipsy
<i>Christian</i> names which were adopted by the race after their
arrival in Europe.&nbsp; I disposed of these trifling and
meaningless objections in their proper places, and need not
reproduce them here. <a name="citation10b"></a><a
href="#footnote10b" class="citation">[10b]</a>&nbsp; The
strangest thing advanced about Bunyan is the assertion that it is
impossible he could have been a Gipsy, because the name existed
in England before the race arrived in it.&nbsp; From this it
would follow that there can be no Gipsies in England, or anywhere
else, because they bear surnames common to the natives of the
soil.&nbsp; The circumstances under which they adopted these, and
how Gipsies of mixed blood are found of all colours, I have on
previous occasions elaborately explained.&nbsp; Hence it can be
said that the writer in the <i>Daily News</i> is not strictly
correct when, in allusion to the two letters to an English
clergyman, contained in the pamphlet, he says that I &ldquo;have
nothing to say to all this;&rdquo; and that &ldquo;this is really
all the evidence, as well as all the argument, forthcoming on the
subject.&rdquo;&nbsp; This subject has no standing if we do not
admit of the existence of a &ldquo;ferocious prejudice of caste
against the name of Gipsy&rdquo;; and that in regard to the
nationality of John Bunyan, &ldquo;the question at issue is
really not one of evidence, but of an unfortunate feeling of
caste that bars the way against all investigation and
proof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apart from John Bunyan personally, the subject of the race to
which he belonged has a very important bearing on the
&ldquo;social emancipation of the Gipsies&rdquo; in the British
Isles.&nbsp; There cannot be less than several hundred thousand
of these in various positions in life&mdash;many, perhaps most of
them, differing in no other way from the &ldquo;ordinary
natives&rdquo; but that in respect to that part of their blood
which is Gipsy, they have sprung, really or representatively,
from <i>the tent</i>&mdash;the hive from which the whole of the
Gipsy tribe have swarmed.&nbsp; Notwithstanding that, this fact
carries certain mental peculiarities with it, which should be
admitted as a preliminary step to a full social equality, should
the incognito Gipsy element in society present itself for that
purpose.</p>
<p>Since the above was written I have read with great interest
the letter from &ldquo;Thomas Bunyan, chief warder, Tower of
London, and born in Roxburghshire,&rdquo; in the <i>Daily
News</i> of the 17th.&nbsp; The origin which he gives of the
<i>name</i> is apparently the correct one, viz.: that &ldquo;the
first Bunyan was an Italian mason, who came to Melrose, and was
at the building of <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>that famous abbey in the year 1136;&rdquo; and that
&ldquo;the oldest gravestone in the graveyard around Melrose
Abbey has on it the name of Bunyan.&rdquo;&nbsp; In my
Disquisition on the Gipsies, published in 1865, I
said:&mdash;&ldquo;The name Bunyan would seem to be of foreign
origin&rdquo; (p. 519).&nbsp; It does not necessarily follow that
the blood of the Italian mason flowed in John Bunyan&rsquo;s
veins, except by it having in some way got mixed with and merged
in that of the Gipsy race. <a name="citation11a"></a><a

<h3>II. <a name="citation11b"></a><a href="#footnote11b"
class="citation">[11b]</a></h3>
<p>The following letter, which I addressed to-day to a clergyman
of the Church of England, applies so well to the Rev. John Brown
of Bunyan Church, Bedford, that it may be considered as the first
part of my reply to his letter in the <i>Daily News</i> of the
22d August.&nbsp; The remainder will follow soon.</p>
<p>I have to thank you for your letter of the 22d August
containing a newspaper slip.&nbsp; You say that the idea of
Bunyan having been of the Gipsy race; &ldquo;from absolute want
of evidence is totally incapable of proof,&rdquo; and &ldquo;from
beginning to end is no better than a conjecture&rdquo;; and that
as proof to the contrary is &ldquo;the fact that before the birth
of Bunyan his ancestors are known to have resided in Bedfordshire
for many generations, some of them having been landed
proprietors.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now read what Bunyan said of
himself:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For my descent, it was, as is well known to
many, of a low and inconsiderable generation, my father&rsquo;s
house being of that rank that is meanest and most despised of all
the families in the land.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This <i>descent</i>, he said, was &ldquo;well known to
<i>many</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Was not that a fact?&nbsp; If it was
<i>then</i> &ldquo;well known to many,&rdquo; how has the
knowledge of it died out in his <i>Church</i> and
neighbourhood?&nbsp; A fact like that could not have been
<i>forgotten</i> within two centuries, during which time
Banyan&rsquo;s memory, with all relating to it, has been
cherished more and more, unless it had been, at some time,
wilfully or tacitly <i>suppressed</i>; and an attempt made to
connect him even with the aristocracy of the country!&nbsp; I
have never seen or heard of an allusion to any of his relations,
although the great probability is that there was an
&ldquo;extensive ramification&rdquo; of them.&nbsp; The reason I
have assigned for that is that &ldquo;very probably his being a
tinker was, with friends and enemies, a circumstance so
altogether discreditable as to render any investigation of the
kind perfectly superfluous&rdquo; (Dis. p. 517). <a
name="citation11c"></a><a href="#footnote11c"
class="citation">[11c]</a>&nbsp; <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>&ldquo;A low and inconsiderable
generation.&rdquo;&nbsp; What did that phrase mean?&nbsp; And as
if that were not sufficient, he added that &ldquo;his
father&rsquo;s house&rdquo; was &ldquo;of that <i>rank</i> that
is <i>meanest</i> and <i>most despised</i> of <i>all</i> the
families in land&rdquo;; and still not satisfied with that, he
continued:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Another thought came into my mind, and that
was, whether we [his family and relations] were of the Israelites
or no?&nbsp; For finding in the Scriptures that they were once
the peculiar people of God, thought I, if I were one of this race
[how significant is the expression!] my soul must needs be
happy.&nbsp; Now again, I found within me a great longing to be
resolved about this question, but could not tell how I
should.&nbsp; At last I asked my father of it, who told me, No,
we [his father included] were not.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my Disquisition on the Gipsies I said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Such a question is entertained by the
Gipsies even at the present day, for they naturally think of the
Jews, and wonder whether, after all, their race may not, at some
time, have been connected with them.&nbsp; I have heard the same
question put by Gipsy lads to their parent (a very much mixed
Gipsy), and it was answered thus:&mdash;&lsquo;We must have been
among the Jews, for some of our ceremonies are like
theirs.&rsquo;&rdquo; (p. 511).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I presume that no one will question the assertions that Bunyan
was a tinker, and that English &ldquo;tinkers&rdquo; are simply
Gipsies of more or less mixed blood.&nbsp; Put together these
three ideas&mdash;his description of his &ldquo;father&rsquo;s
house,&rdquo; and their not being Jews, but tinkers, that is,
Gipsies of mixed blood&mdash;and you have the evidence or proof
that John Bunyan was of the Gipsy race.&nbsp; If people are
<i>hanged</i> on circumstantial evidence, cannot the same kind of
proof be used to explain the language which Bunyan used to
<i>remind</i> the world who and what he was, at a time when it
was death by law for being a Gipsy, and &ldquo;felony without
benefit of clergy&rdquo; for associating with them, and odious to
the rest of the population?&nbsp; From all that we know of
Bunyan, we could safely conclude that he was not the man to leave
the world in doubt as to who and what he was.&nbsp; He even
<i>reminded</i> it of what it <i>knew well</i>; but with his
usual discretion he abstained from using a word that was banned
by the law of the land and the more despotic decree of society,
and concluded that it perfectly understood what he meant,
although there was no necessity, or even occasion, for him to do
what he did. <a name="citation12"></a><a href="#footnote12"
class="citation">[12]</a></p>
<p>Why then say that there is an &ldquo;absolute want of
evidence&rdquo; in regard to Bunyan having been of the Gipsy
race, and that it is &ldquo;totally incapable of proof&rdquo;;
and assert that it is a <i>fact</i> that his ancestors were
&ldquo;landed proprietors,&rdquo; and that there might be better
grounds for holding <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>that Bunyan was of <i>Norman</i> origin than of
<i>Gipsy</i> descent?</p>
<p>Bunyan was either of the Gipsy race (of mixed blood) or of the
native one.&nbsp; I have given the proof of the
former&mdash;proof which, I think, is sufficient to hang a
man.&nbsp; Where is the proof of his having been something else
than of the Gipsy race?&nbsp; And if there is no proof of that,
why assert it?&nbsp; What Bunyan said of his family was
<i>proof</i> that he was <i>not</i> of the <i>native</i>
race.&nbsp; Asserting as a <i>fact</i> that, from the surname,
his ancestors were ordinary natives of England, and landed
proprietors at that, is nearly as unreasonable as to maintain
that every English Gipsy of the name of Stanley is nearly related
to the Earl of Derby because <i>his</i> name is Stanley.</p>
<p>Like any one charged with an offense unbecoming Englishmen,
almost any of them will protest that <i>he</i> has no prejudice
against the name of Gipsy, and that &ldquo;he would not have the
smallest objection to believe that Bunyan was one of the race if
the fact was only proved by sufficient evidence&rdquo;; while at
the same time he will retain and manifest his prejudices, and
entirely ignore the evidence, or refuse to say in what respect it
is deficient, and believe the opposite, or something entirely
different from it, without a particle of proof in its favour, or
entirely <i>disproved</i> by Bunyan&rsquo;s admission in regard
to his &ldquo;father&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Gipsy subject will not always remain in its present
position.&nbsp; It will sooner or later have a resurrection, when
some one will see who were the &ldquo;goats&rdquo; on the
occasion.&nbsp; Bunyan will occupy a very important position in
what is now represented by the following extract from my
Disquisition on the Gipsies, published in London in
1865:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is beyond doubt that there cannot be
less than a quarter of a million of Gipsies in the British Isles,
who are living under a grinding despotism of caste; a despotism
so absolute and odious that the people upon whom it bears,
cannot, as in Scotland, were it almost to save their lives, even
say who they are!&rdquo; (p. 440).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>III. <a name="citation13"></a><a href="#footnote13"
class="citation">[13]</a></h3>
<p>The main thing to be considered in regard to Mr. Brown is to
ascertain his motive for investigating the question whether or
not John Bunyan was of the Gipsy race, and the steps he took to
that end.&nbsp; I am satisfied that his <i>only</i> motive, from
first to last, has been to get rid, under any circumstances, of
what <i>he</i> considers a stigma cast on Bunyan&rsquo;s
memory.&nbsp; He is apparently entirely ignorant of the subject
of the Gipsies, and will listen to nothing that bears on
Bunyan&rsquo;s nationality.&nbsp; How then does it happen that
<i>he</i> should step out into the world and say so positively
that Bunyan was <i>not</i> of the Gipsy race?&nbsp; His
<i>first</i> &ldquo;proof&rdquo; was the discovery that the
<i>name</i> of Bunyan existed in England before the Gipsies
arrived in it, so that on that account John Bunyan&rsquo;s family
could not have been Gipsies, but a broken-down branch of an
aristocratic family!&nbsp; That &ldquo;proof&rdquo; proving
worthless, he has recourse to what he finds to have been
Bunyan&rsquo;s ancestor, apparently on the &ldquo;native side of
the house,&rdquo; viz.: Thomas Bonyon, who succeeded his father,
William Bonyon, in 1542, to the property of &ldquo;Bunyan&rsquo;s
End,&rdquo; that is, a cottage and nine acres of land, about a
mile from Elstow Church.&nbsp; This Thomas is described as
&ldquo;a labourer, and his wife as a brewer of beer and &lsquo;a
baker <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>of
human bread.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; In my Disquisition on the
Gipsies I said in regard to John Bunyan:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Beyond being a Gipsy it is impossible to
say what his pedigree really was.&nbsp; His grandfather might
have been an ordinary native, even of fair birth, who, in a
thoughtless moment, might have &lsquo;gone off with the
Gipsies;&rsquo; or his ancestor on the native side of the house
might have been one of the &lsquo;many English loiterers&rsquo;
who joined the Gipsies on their arrival in England, when they
were &lsquo;esteemed and held in great admiration&rsquo;&rdquo;
(p. 518).&nbsp; And, &ldquo;Let a Gipsy once be grafted upon a
native family and she rises with it; leavens the little circle of
which she is the centre, and leaves it and its descendants for
all time coming Gipsies&rdquo; (p. 412). <a
name="citation14a"></a><a href="#footnote14a"
class="citation">[14a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thomas Bonyon seems to have been born about 1502, <a
name="citation14b"></a><a href="#footnote14b"
class="citation">[14b]</a> and was apparently of the native race,
as was probably his wife; but between him and Thomas
(John&rsquo;s grandfather), whose will was dated in 1641, there
were doubtless several generations.&nbsp; Without asking with
whom each generation of this family married, Mr. Brown
says:&mdash;&ldquo;Here, then, we have a family living certainly
in the same cottage and cultivating the same land from 1542 to
1641, and probably much earlier, a fact which seems to me utterly
fatal to the theory of Gipsy blood&rdquo;&mdash;assuming that the
blood of the family through marriage was native English all the
way down; and that they cultivated the nine acres of land, and
did not rent or sell it, for Thomas Bunyan by his will, dated in
1641, leaves &ldquo;the cottage or tenement wherein I doe now
dwell.&rdquo;&nbsp; This Thomas could not have been less than the
grandson of the first-mentioned Thomas, and described himself in
his will, dated November 20th, 1641, as a &ldquo;pettie
chapman&rdquo;&mdash;a calling that is very common with Gipsies
of mixed blood.&nbsp; The will of his son Thomas (John&rsquo;s
father) is dated May 28th, 1675, in which he describes himself as
a &ldquo;braseyer&rdquo;&mdash;which is a favourite word with the
Gipsies, and sounds better than tinker, and is frequently put on
their tombstones.&nbsp; Mr. Brown says:&mdash;&ldquo;From this it
appears that Bunyan&rsquo;s father was the first tinker in the
family.&rdquo;&nbsp; Instead of that, he should have said that it
was the first one <i>found in a will</i>.&nbsp; Again he says
that he has discovered from the annual returns of the parishes in
Bedfordshire between 1603 and 1650, that &ldquo;the families both
of Bunyan&rsquo;s father and of his mother, Margaret Bentley,
were living there all this time as steadily as any of the other
village families, and as unlike a Gipsy encampment as can well be
conceived.&rdquo;&nbsp; He found no such information in
&ldquo;annual parish returns,&rdquo; but perhaps merely the fact
of Bunyan&rsquo;s father having had his legal and general
residence at the cottage, while he followed his calling of
tinkering all over the neighbourhood, as regulated by the chief
of the tinkers or Gipsies for the district.&nbsp; Beyond the
cottage being the residence of Thomas, we know nothing of his
movements, nor of the company coming to his house; and if <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>Mr. Brown had
known anything of the subject of the Gipsies, or been willing to
learn it from others, he would not have concluded that the
Bunyans were not of that race, merely because they might not (as
they probably did not) use a tent.&nbsp; It would appear that Mr.
Brown has not mastered even the first principle of this subject,
so as to be able to define what is meant by it being said that
Bunyan was or was not of the Gipsy race.</p>
<p>Thomas Bonyon, in 1542, called a &ldquo;labourer&rdquo; in a
legal document or record, and his wife a &ldquo;brewer and
baker,&rdquo; appear to have kept a little wayside public-house,
which would be frequented by the Gipsies, especially when they
were &ldquo;esteemed and held in great admiration.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And here it is likely that the <i>native English</i> Bunyans were
changed into <i>English Gipsy</i> Bunyans by the male heir of
Thomas marrying a Gipsy, whose son or grandson was Thomas, the
&ldquo;pettie chapman&rdquo;; and whose son Thomas, the
&ldquo;braseyer,&rdquo; was the father of John.&nbsp; All these
would doubtless marry early, but perhaps not so early as John,
who married before he was nineteen, so far as is known.</p>
<p>In my communication of the 6th September, I think I said
enough on the question of proof as to Bunyan having been of the
Gipsy race.&nbsp; Even with the limited knowledge about the race
generally, and especially about the mixture of its blood, before
I published a history of the Gipsies, Sir Walter Scott (an
excellent judge), with reference to the rank of his
father&rsquo;s house, and not being Jews, but tinkers, said that
Bunyan was &ldquo;most probably a Gipsy reclaimed.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mr. Offor, an editor of Bunyan&rsquo;s works, said that
&ldquo;his father must have been a Gipsy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr.
Leland&rsquo;s investigation and decision is that he &ldquo;was a
Gipsy,&rdquo; even apparently on the sole ground of his having
been a tinker.&nbsp; In regard to myself, Mr. Brown says that I
have &ldquo;really nothing to go upon but Bunyan&rsquo;s own
words, in which he says that his father&rsquo;s house was
&lsquo;of that rank that is meanest and most despised of all the
families of [in] the land,&rsquo; which might simply mean that
his father was a poor man in a village&rdquo;(!)&nbsp; According
to Mr. Brown, Bunyan&rsquo;s admission, or rather
<i>reminder</i>, had no bearing on his nationality, while others
think it conclusive, apart from his having been a tinker.&nbsp;
But Mr. Brown did not give <i>all</i> of Bunyan&rsquo;s language,
for he left out the most important part of it, which was that of
his <i>descent</i>, which was <i>well known to many</i> to have
been of a <i>low and inconsiderable generation</i>, which had no
reference to his &ldquo;father being a poor man in a
village.&rdquo;&nbsp; He also omitted Bunyan&rsquo;s question as
to his &ldquo;father&rsquo;s house&rdquo; being or not being
Jews, using the word <i>we</i> in both instances; a discussion
that could not have taken place between a father and a son of any
of the <i>ordinary race</i> of Englishmen.&nbsp; In this way Mr.
Brown gets rid of the proof that proceeded from Bunyan himself,
by simply brushing it aside.&nbsp; When I saw him in New York, I
alluded to <i>all</i> of Bunyan&rsquo;s admissions, when he
replied, &ldquo;Oh, that can be easily explained.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a
name="citation15a"></a><a href="#footnote15a"
class="citation">[15a]</a>&nbsp; And when I said that &ldquo;one
cannot say in England that Bunyan was a Gipsy, for society would
not allow it,&rdquo; he made no reply, so far as I noticed, but
appeared to wince at the remark.&nbsp; I had some hesitation in
giving Mr. Brown an interview, for I was satisfied that he did
not wish to have the truth about Bunyan admitted; but I concluded
that, having sent him some pamphlets, it would have been rude to
refuse him one. <a name="citation15b"></a><a href="#footnote15b"
class="citation">[15b]</a>&nbsp; It lasted only about <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>five minutes,
at the entrance of a banking-house in Broadway, and ended with
some remarks about his having found the wills of the Bunyans; not
one word of which was to the point in question.&nbsp; His only
motive for an interview seemed to be to gratify his curiosity and
behold the person who would dare to &ldquo;cast a stigma on
Bunyan&rsquo;s memory.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now he says that there is
<i>no</i> &ldquo;ferocious prejudice of caste against the name of
Gipsy,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;none of Bunyan&rsquo;s admirers
would object to his being shown to be a Gipsy, if only sufficient
proof were adduced&rdquo;; while he has ignored everything that
bears upon the subject, even what came out of Bunyan&rsquo;s
mouth. <a name="citation16a"></a><a href="#footnote16a"
class="citation">[16a]</a>&nbsp; In place of being influenced by
evidence, he put forth the fanciful idea that he could not have
been a Gipsy because the name of Bunyan existed in England before
the Gipsies arrived there.&nbsp; And now he maintains that Bunyan
could not have been a Gipsy, because he owed his descent
&ldquo;on the native side of the house&rdquo; to Thomas Bonyon, a
labourer or publican or both, born about 1502, without regard to
the &ldquo;marriages and movements&rdquo; of perhaps five or six
generations till the birth of the immortal dreamer, who was
baptized on the 30th November, 1628.</p>
<p>But for the limited space at my disposal I would put a long
string of questions to Mr. Brown, and suggest a course of action
for him to undo the injury he has done to Bunyan and the Gipsy
race generally, particularly owing to his remarks about the
illustrious pilgrim having been credited and circulated by the
press in Great Britain, which complicates the question in all its
bearings. <a name="citation16b"></a><a href="#footnote16b"
class="citation">[16b]</a>&nbsp; We <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>have heard much of the
<i>American</i> John Brown in connexion with the emancipation of
the Negroes in the United States, while the <i>English</i> John
Brown seems to be doing his best, directly or indirectly, to
rivet the fetters of a social despotism on a large body of his
fellow-creatures in the British Islands.</p>
<p>I have said above that Thomas Bonyon and his wife, living in
1542, were <i>apparently</i> of the native English race, and made
my remarks to correspond with that idea.&nbsp; But there was more
than a <i>possibility</i> of them having been part of the
original Gipsy stock, of mixed blood, that arrived in Great
Britain before 1506, and, like their race generally, assumed the
surname of a &ldquo;good family in the land,&rdquo; as I will
illustrate at some length in my next communication, which will
make its appearance in due time.</p>
<h3>IV. <a name="citation17"></a><a href="#footnote17"
class="citation">[17]</a></h3>
<p>I said in my communication of the 8th that there was more than
a possibility of Thomas Bonyon and his wife, in 1542, having been
of the original stock of Gipsies, of mixed blood, that assumed
the surname of a &ldquo;good family in the land.&rdquo;&nbsp; As
illustrative of this question, we have a writ of the Scots&rsquo;
parliament, of the 8th April, 1554, pardoning thirteen Gipsies
for the slaughter of Ninian Small, their names being the
following:&mdash;&ldquo;Andro Faw, captain of the Egyptians,
George Faw, Robert Faw, and Anthony Faw, his sons, Johnne Faw,
Andrew George Nichoah, George Sebastiane Colyne, George Colyne,
Julie Colyne, Johnne Colyne, James Haw, <i>Johnne Browne</i>, and
<i>George Browne</i>, Egyptians.&rdquo;&nbsp; There being thus
Gipsies of the name of <i>Brown</i> (and, oddly enough, one
called <i>John Brown</i>), in Scotland before 1554, we should
have no difficulty in believing that there were, or might have
been, some in England of the name of <i>Bonyon</i> in 1542.&nbsp;
The only native name assumed by the tribe in Scotland before
1540, when they were noticed officially, was Bailyow, or
Baillie.&nbsp; And how did we have Gipsies in Scotland of the
name of <i>Brown</i> (apparently the only native name, except
Baillie), in a public document before 1554?&nbsp; Between 1506
and 1579 was the &ldquo;golden age&rdquo; of the Gipsies in
Scotland, excepting (nominally, at least) the year 1541&ndash;2,
for, on the 6th June, 1541, they were ordered to leave the realm
within thirty days, on pain of death, owing to an attack made by
them on James V. while roaming over the country in
disguise.&nbsp; &ldquo;But the king, whom, according to
tradition, they had personally so deeply offended, dying in the
following year (1542), a new reign brought new prospects to the
denounced wanderers&rdquo; (His., p. 107).&nbsp; There is a
tradition that the Gipsies were in Scotland before 1460, for
McLellan of Bombie happening to kill a chief of some
&ldquo;Saracens or Gipsies from Ireland,&rdquo; was reinstated in
the Barony of Bombie, and took for his crest a Moor&rsquo;s head,
and &ldquo;Think on&rdquo; for his motto.&nbsp; And it is a
tradition amongst all the Scottish Gipsies that their ancestors
came by way of Ireland into Scotland.&nbsp; How, then, were there
Gipsies described, in a writ of the Scots&rsquo; parliament, by
the names of John and George Brown in 1554?&nbsp; In no other
apparent way, during their &ldquo;golden age,&rdquo; than that a
native <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>or
natives of that name had married into the tribe, and that the two
Browns, perhaps brothers, mentioned were the issue, and grown-up
men at that; so that the marriage could not have taken place
later than 1533, and probably considerably earlier.&nbsp; There
was little chance of a Scotch lawyer describing these two Browns
as &ldquo;Egyptians&rdquo; unless they had been the children of a
native father, or had previously assumed the surname of Brown;
the first being the most probable. <a name="citation18"></a><a
href="#footnote18" class="citation">[18]</a></p>
<p>If we can imagine that William Bonyon, the first of the name
mentioned by Mr. Brown, had been a native of England, and, like
the Scotch Brown, had married a Gipsy, we would have found
Thomas, in 1542, a member of the tribe.&nbsp; It was not
necessary that he should have been 40 years old in 1542, or that
the property of &ldquo;Bunyan&rsquo;s End&rdquo; &ldquo;had
probably been in the possession of the family long before
1542&rdquo;; or that William had not died in middle life, leaving
Thomas a young man, born of a Gipsy mother.&nbsp; Even William
might have been one of the original Gipsies, of mixed blood, that
is, &ldquo;such a &lsquo;foreign tinker&rsquo; as is alluded to
in the Spanish Gipsy edicts, and in the Act of Queen Elizabeth,
in which mention is made of &lsquo;strangers,&rsquo; as
distinguished from natural-born subjects, being with the Gipsies
. . .&nbsp; It is therefore very likely that there was not a drop
of common English blood in Bunyan&rsquo;s veins.&nbsp; John
Bunyan belongs to the world at large, and England is only
entitled to the credit of the formation of his character&rdquo;
(p. 518).&nbsp; He might have assumed the name of Bonyon and
bought &ldquo;Bunyan&rsquo;s End,&rdquo; when the severe law was
passed by Henry VIII. against the race about 1530.&nbsp; Thomas
might have been an ordinary native of England and married a Gipsy
who was a &ldquo;brewer and baker,&rdquo; possibly of the second
generation of the race born in England.&nbsp; She seems to have
been a &ldquo;lawless lass&rdquo; of some kind, for Mr. Brown
says that it is on record that &ldquo;between 1542 and 1550 she
was fined six or eight times for breaking the assize of beer and
bread.&rdquo;&nbsp; On this head I said in the Disquisition on
the Gipsies:&mdash;&ldquo;Considering what is popularly
understood to be the natural disposition and capacity of the
Gipsies, we would readily conclude that to turn innkeepers would
be the most unlikely of all their employments; yet that is very
common&rdquo; (p. 467), all over Europe from almost the day of
their arrival in it.&nbsp; It is no uncommon thing for English
Gipsies who have the means to buy a small house with a little
ground attached on landing in America, even should they not
always occupy it personally.&nbsp; I have been informed of
several such <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>purchases, and knew the owner of one
&ldquo;homestead&rdquo; intimately, and was often in his
house.&nbsp; And this seems to have been a trait in the character
of the superior Gipsies of mixed blood in Great Britain, perhaps
from the time of their arrival.</p>
<p>With regard to the pedigree of John Bunyan, the most probable
one seems to be the following:&mdash;William Bonyon and his wife
were apparently ordinary English people, which would make Thomas
of the same race. <a name="citation19"></a><a href="#footnote19"
class="citation">[19]</a>&nbsp; His wife&mdash;the &ldquo;lawless
brewer and baker&rdquo;&mdash;was either of the native race or of
a superior class of mixed Gipsies, perhaps of the second
generation born in England.&nbsp; If she was the former, the male
heir of Thomas married a Gipsy while he kept his little wayside
public-house, leading to their issue being turned into the Gipsy
current in society.&nbsp; Thus the little property of
&ldquo;Bunyan&rsquo;s End&rdquo; (at least the cottage) would
remain in the family, leading to a will being made to bequeath it
from generation to generation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Petty chapmen and
tinkers&rdquo; (using brazier instead of tinker) are the happiest
words that could be used to describe many Gipsies of mixed blood
in England to-day.</p>
<p>A remark in the <i>Graphic</i> for the 26th August, in
adopting Mr. Brown&rsquo;s <i>theory</i> that <i>all</i> that
sprung from Thomas Bonyon, in 1542, were <i>ordinary natives</i>
of England, makes it very plain what is the motive for not having
it said that Bunyan was of the Gipsy race, viz.: to show that his
were &ldquo;positively respectable&rdquo; people, and not
&ldquo;tinkering Gipsies.&rdquo;&nbsp; Petty chapmen and tinkers,
if of the native race, would be &ldquo;positively
respectable,&rdquo; but not if they had had a &ldquo;dash&rdquo;
of Gipsy blood in their veins (which <i>might</i> have improved
them,) <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>and
held by the Gipsy connexion, if for no other reason than that the
white blood would have disowned them if they had known of its
existence.&nbsp; In this way they would be cut off from the
native race, or would mix with it no further than was
unavoidable; living thus as Gipsies <i>incog.</i>, or as
outcasts, for that is the right word to use till the Gipsy blood
becomes acknowledged by the rest of the world.&nbsp; The
<i>Graphic</i> &ldquo;let the cat out of the bag,&rdquo; and
somewhat illustrated what I meant when I spoke of the
&ldquo;ferocious prejudice of caste against the name of
Gipsy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I refer to the Disquisition on the Gipsies and my subsequent
writings on John Bunyan and the Gipsies, and add a few extracts
from the Disquisition; all of which should have been studied by
Mr. Brown before &ldquo;putting his foot into&rdquo; the subject
in the way he has done, for that is of too sacred a nature to be
treated factiously or capriciously.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The world generally has never even thought
about this subject.&nbsp; When I have spoken to people
promiscuously in regard to it, they have replied, &lsquo;We
suppose that the Gipsies as they have settled in life have got
lost among the general population&rsquo;; than which nothing can
be more unfounded as a matter of fact, or ridiculous as a matter
of theory&rdquo; (p. 454).&mdash;&ldquo;What difficulty can there
therefore be in understanding how a man can be a Gipsy whose
blood is mixed, even &lsquo;dreadfully mixed,&rsquo; as the
English Gipsies express it?&nbsp; Gipsies are Gipsies, let their
blood be mixed as much as it may, whether the introduction of the
native blood may have come into the family through the male or
the female line.&nbsp; In the descent of . . . the Gipsy race,
the thing to be transmitted is not merely a question of family,
but a race distinct from any particular family&rdquo; (p.
451).&mdash;&ldquo;The principle of progression, the passing
through one phase of history into another, while the race
maintains its identity, holds good with the Gipsies as well as
with any other people&rdquo; (p. 414).&mdash;&ldquo;Take a Gipsy
from any country in the world you may, and the feeling of his
being a Gipsy comes as naturally to him as does the nationality
of a Jew to a Jew; although we will naturally give him a more
definite name to distinguish him, such as an English, Welsh,
Scotch, or Irish Gipsy, or by whatever country of which the Gipsy
happens to be a native&rdquo; (p. 447).&mdash;&ldquo;But it is
impossible for any one to give an account of the Gipsies in
Scotland from the year 1506 down to the present time.&nbsp; This
much, however, can be said of them, that they are as much Gipsies
now as ever they were; that is, the Gipsies of to-day are the
representatives of the race as it appeared in Scotland three
centuries and a half ago, and hold themselves to be Gipsies now,
as indeed they always will do&rdquo; (p. 466).&mdash;&ldquo;The
admission of the good man alluded to casts a flood of light upon
the history of the Scottish Gipsy race, shrouded as it is from
the eye of the general population; but the information given by
him was apt to fall flat upon the ear of the ordinary native
unless it was accompanied by some such exposition of the subject
as is given in this work.&nbsp; Still, we can gather from it
where Gipsies are to be found, what <i>a</i> Scottish Gipsy is,
and what the race is capable of, and what might be expected of
it, if the prejudice of their fellow-creatures was withdrawn from
the race, as distinguished from the various classes into which it
may be divided, or, I should rather say, the personal conduct of
each Gipsy individually&rdquo; (p. 415).&mdash;&ldquo;It is a
subject, however, which I have found some difficulty in getting
people to understand.&nbsp; One cannot see how a person can be a
Gipsy &lsquo;because his father was a respectable man&rsquo;;
another, &lsquo;because his father was an old soldier&rsquo;; and
another cannot see &lsquo;how it necessarily follows that a
person is a Gipsy for the reason that his parents were
Gipsies&rsquo;&rdquo; (p. 505).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apart from the prejudice of caste now existing against the
Gipsies, and the novelty of the light in which the race is now
presented, there should be no difficulty in understanding the
subject in all its bearings.&nbsp; Every other race entering
England has had justice done to it; and the same should not be
withheld from people who claim to be &ldquo;members of the Gipsy
tribe,&rdquo; although their blood, perhaps in the most of
instances, is more of the ordinary than of the Gipsy race.</p>

<div class="gapmediumline">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span><span
class="smcap">Ever</span> since entering Great Britain, about the
year 1506, the Gipsies have been drawing into their body the
blood of the ordinary inhabitants and conforming to their ways;
and so prolific has the race been, that there cannot be less than
250,000 Gipsies of all castes, colours, characters, occupations,
degrees of education, culture, and position in life, in the
British Isles alone, and possibly double that number.&nbsp; There
are many of the same race in the United States of America.&nbsp;
Indeed, there have been Gipsies in America from nearly the first
day of its settlement; for many of the race were banished to the
plantations, often for very trifling offences, and sometimes
merely for being by &ldquo;habit and repute
Egyptians.&rdquo;&nbsp; But as the Gipsy race leaves the tent,
and rises to civilization, it hides its nationality from the rest
of the world, so great is the prejudice against the name of
Gipsy.&nbsp; In Europe and America together, there cannot be less
than 4,000,000 Gipsies in existence.&nbsp; John Bunyan, the
author of the celebrated <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>, was one
of this singular people, as will be conclusively shown in the
present work.&nbsp; The philosophy of the existence of the Jews,
since the dispersion, will also be discussed and established in
it.</p>
<p>When the &ldquo;wonderful story&rdquo; of the Gipsies is told,
as it ought to be told, it constitutes a work of interest to many
classes of readers, being a subject unique, distinct from, and
unknown to, the rest of the human family.&nbsp; In the present
work, the race has been treated of so fully and elaborately, in
all its aspects, as in a great measure to fill and satisfy the
mind, instead of being, as heretofore, little better than a myth
to the understanding of the most intelligent person.</p>
<p>The history of the Gipsies, when thus comprehensively treated,
forms a study for the most advanced and cultivated mind, as well
as for the youth whose intellectual and literary character is
still to be formed; and furnishes, among other things, a system
of science not too abstract in its nature, and having for its
subject-matter the strongest of human feelings and
sympathies.&nbsp; The work also seeks to raise the name of Gipsy
out of the dust, where it now lies; while it has a very important
bearing on the conversion of the Jews, the advancement of
Christianity generally, and the development of historical and
moral science.</p>

<p><i>National Quarterly Review</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;The title of
this work gives a correct idea of its character; the matter fully
justifies it.&nbsp; Even in its original form it was the most
interesting and reliable history of the Gipsies with which we
were acquainted.&nbsp; But it is now much enlarged, and brought
down to the present time.&nbsp; The disquisition on the past,
present, and future of that singular race, added by the editor,
greatly enhances the value of the work, for it embodies the
results of extensive research and careful
investigation.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The chapter on the Gipsy
language should be read by all who take any interest either in
comparative philology or ethnology; for it is much more curious
and instructive than most people would expect from the nature of
the subject.&nbsp; The volume is well printed and neatly bound,
and has the advantage of a copious alphabetical index.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Congregational Review</i>. (Beaton.)&mdash;&ldquo;The
senior partner in the authorship of this book was a Scotchman who
made it his life-long pleasure to go a &lsquo;Gipsy
hunting,&rsquo; to use his own phrase.&nbsp; He was a personal
friend of Sir Walter Scott. . . . His enthusiasm was genuine, his
diligence great, his sagacity remarkable, and his discoveries
rewarding.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The book is undoubtedly the
fullest and most reliable which our language contains on the
subject.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;This volume is valuable for its
instruction, and exceedingly amusing anecdotically.&nbsp; It
overruns with the humorous.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The subject in
its present form is novel, and we freely add, very
sensational.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Indeed, the book assures us that
our country is full of this people, mixed up as they have become,
by marriage, with all the European stocks during the last three
centuries.&nbsp; The amalgamation has done much to merge them in
the general current of modern education and civilization; yet
they retain their language with closest tenacity, as a sort of
Freemason medium of intercommunion; and while they never are
willing to own their origin among outsiders, they are very proud
of it among themselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We had regarded them
as entitled to considerable antiquity, but we now find that they
were none other than the &lsquo;mixed multitude&rsquo; which
accompanied the Hebrew exode (Ex. XII 38) under
Moses&mdash;straggling or disaffected Egyptians, who went along
to ventilate their discontent, or to improve their fortunes. . .
. We are not prepared to take issue with these authors on any of
the points raised by them.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Methodist Quarterly Review</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Have we
Gipsies among us!&nbsp; Yea, verily, if Mr. Simson is to be
believed, they swarm our country in secret legions.&nbsp; There
is no place on the four quarters of the globe where some of them
have not penetrated.&nbsp; Even in New England a sly Gipsy girl
will enter the factory as employe, will by her allurements win a
young Jonathan to marry her, and in due season, the &rsquo;cute
gentleman will find himself the father of a young brood of
intense Gipsies.&nbsp; The mother will have opened to her young
progeny the mystery and <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>the romance of its lineage, will have
disclosed its birth-right connection with a secret brotherhood,
whose profounder Freemasonry is based on blood, historically
extending itself into the most dim antiquity, and geographically
spreading over most of the earth.&nbsp; The fascinations of this
mystic tie are wonderful.&nbsp; Afraid or ashamed to reveal the
secret to the outside world, the young Gipsy is inwardly
intensely proud of his unique nobility, and is very likely to
despise his alien father, who is of course glad to keep the late
discovered secret from the world.&nbsp; Hence dear reader, you
know not but your next neighbour is a Gipsy.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;The volume before us possesses a rare interest, both from
the unique character of the subject, and from the absence of
nearly any other source of full information.&nbsp; It is the
result of observation from real life.&rdquo;&nbsp; The language
&ldquo;is spoken with varying dialects in different countries,
but with standard purity in Hungary.&nbsp; It is the precious
inheritance and proud peculiarity of the Gipsy, which he will
never forget and seldom reveal.&nbsp; The varied and skillful
man&oelig;uvres of Mr. Simeon to purloin or wheedle out a small
vocabulary, with the various effects of the operation on the
minds and actions of the Gipsies, furnish many an amusing
narrative in these pages.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Persecutions of the
most cruel character have embittered and barbarized them. . . .
Even now . . . they do not realize the kindly feeling of
enlightened minds toward them, and view with fierce suspicion
every approach designed to draw from them the secrets of their
history, habits, laws and language.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The age
of racial caste is passing away.&nbsp; Modern Christianity will
refuse to tolerate the spirit of hostility and oppression based
on feature, colour, or lineage.&rdquo;&nbsp; The &ldquo;book is
an intended first step for the improvement of the race that forms
its subject, and every magnanimous spirit must wish that it may
prove not the last.&nbsp; We heartily commend the work to our
readers as not only full of fascinating details, but abounding
with points of interest to the benevolent Christian
heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The general spirit of the work is
eminently enlightened, liberal, and humane.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Evangelical Quarterly Review</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;The Gipsies,
their race and language have always excited a more than ordinary
interest.&nbsp; The work before us, apparently the result of
careful research, is a comprehensive history of this singular
people, abounding in marvelous incidents and curious
information.&nbsp; It is highly instructive, and there is
appended a full and most careful index&mdash;so important in
every work.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>National Freemason</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;We feel confident that
our readers will relish the following concerning the Gipsies,
from the British Masonic Organ: That an article on Gipsyism is
not out of place in this Magazine will be admitted by every one
who knows anything of the history, manners, and customs of these
strange wanderers among the nations of the earth.&nbsp; The
Freemasons have a language, words, and signs peculiar to
themselves; so have the Gipsies.&nbsp; A Freemason has in every
country a friend, and in every climate a home, secured to him by
the mystic influence of that worldwide association to which he
belongs; similar are the privileges of the Gipsy.&nbsp; But here,
of course, the analogy ceases.&nbsp; Freemasonry is an Order
banded together for purposes of the highest benevolence.&nbsp;
Gipsyism, we fear, has been a source of constant trouble and
inconvenience to European nations.&nbsp; The interest, therefore,
which as Masons we may evince in the Gipsies arises principally,
we may say wholly, from the fact of their being a secret society,
and also from the fact that many of them are enrolled in our
lodges. . . .&nbsp; There are <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>in the United Kingdom a vast
multitude of mixed Gipsies, differing very little in outward
appearance, manners, and customs from ordinary Britons; but in
heart thorough Gipsies, as carefully and jealously guarding their
language and secrets, as we do the secrets of the Masonic
Order.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Simson makes masterly
establishment of the fact that John Bunyan, the world-renowned
author of the &lsquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress,&rsquo; was
descended from Gipsy blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>New York Independent</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Such a book is the
History of the Gipsies.&nbsp; Every one who has a fondness for
the acquisition of out-of-the-way knowledge, chiefly for the
pleasure afforded by its possession, will like this book.&nbsp;
It contains a mass of facts, of stories, and of legends connected
with the Gipsies; a variety of theories as to their origin . . .
and various interesting incidents of adventures among these
modern Ishmaelites.&nbsp; There is a great deal of curious
information to be obtained from this history, nearly all of which
will be new to Americans.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is singular that
so little attention has been heretofore given to this particular
topic; but it is probably owing to the fact that Gipsies are so
careful to keep outsiders from a knowledge of their language that
they even deny its existence.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The history is
just the book with which to occupy one&rsquo;s idle moments; for,
whatever else it lacks, it certainly is not wanting in
interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>New York Observer</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Among the peoples of
the world, the Gipsies are the most mysterious and
romantic.&nbsp; Their origin, modes of life, and habits have
been, until quite recently, rather conjectural than known.&nbsp;
Mr. Walter Simson, after years of investigation and study,
produced a history of this remarkable people which is unrivalled
for the amount of information which it conveys in a manner
adapted to excite the deepest interest.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We
are glad that Mr. James Simson has not felt the same timidity,
but has given the book to the public, having enriched it with
many notes, an able introduction, and a disquisition upon the
past, present, and future of the Gipsy race.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Of the Gipsies in Spain we have already learned much from
the work of Borrow, but this is a more thorough and elaborate
treatise upon Gipsy life in general, though largely devoted to
the tribe as it appeared in England and Scotland.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Such are some views and opinions respecting a curious
people, of whose history and customs Mr. Simson has given a
deeply interesting delineation.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>New York Methodist</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;The Gipsies present
one of the most remarkable anomalies in the history of the human
race.&nbsp; Though they have lived among European nations for
centuries, forming in some districts a prominent element in the
population, they have succeeded in keeping themselves separate in
social relations, customs, language, and in a measure, in
government, and excluding strangers from real knowledge of the
character of their communities and organizations.&nbsp; Scarcely
more is known of them by the world in general than was know when
they first made their appearance among civilized
nations.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Another curious thing advanced by
Mr. Simson is that of the perpetuity of the race . . . He thinks
that it never dies out, and that Gipsies, however much they may
intermarry with the world&rsquo;s people, and adopt the habits of
civilisation, remain Gipsies, preserve the language, the Gipsy
mode of thought, and loyalty to the race and its traditions to
remote generations.&nbsp; His work turns, in fact, upon these two
theories, and the incidents, <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>facts, and citations from history
with which it abounds, are all skillfully used in support of
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;There are some facts of interest in
relation to the Gipsies in Scotland and America, which are
brought out quite fully in Mr. Simson&rsquo;s book,&rdquo; which
&ldquo;abounds in novel and interesting matter . . . and will
well repay perusal.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Pertinent anecdotes,
illustrating the habits and craft of the Gipsies, may be picked
up at random in any part of the book.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>New York Evening Post</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;The editor corrects
some popular notions in regard to the habits of the
Gipsies.&nbsp; They are not now, in the main, the wanderers they
used to be.&nbsp; Through intermarriage with other people, and
from other causes, they have adopted more stationary modes of
life, and have assimilated to the manners of the countries in
which they live.&nbsp; As the editor of this volume says:
&lsquo;They carry the language, the associations, and the
sympathies of their race, and their peculiar feelings toward the
community with them; and, as residents of towns, have greater
facilities, from others of their race residing near them, for
perpetuating their language, than when strolling over the
country.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We have no space for such
full extracts as we should like to give.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>New York Journal of Commerce</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;We have
seldom found a more readable book than Simson&rsquo;s History of
the Gipsies.&nbsp; A large part of the volume is necessarily
devoted to the local histories of families in England (Scotland),
but these go to form part of one of the most interesting chapters
of human history.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We commend the book as very
readable, and giving much instruction on a curious
subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>New York Times</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. . . . has done good
service to the American public by reproducing here this very
interesting and valuable volume.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The work is
more interesting than a romance, and that it is full of facts is
very easily seen by a glance at the index, which is very minute,
and adds greatly to the value of the book.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>New York Albion</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;An extremely curious work
is a History of the Gipsies.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The wildest
scenes in &lsquo;Lavengro,&rsquo; as for instance the fight with
the Flaming Tinman, are comparatively tame beside some of the
incidents narrated here.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Hours at Home</i> (<i>now Scribner&rsquo;s
Monthly</i>).&mdash;&ldquo;Years ago we read, with an interest we
shall never forget, Borrow&rsquo;s book on the Gipsies of
Spain.&nbsp; We have now a history of this mysterious race as it
exists in the British Islands, which, though written before
Borrow&rsquo;s, has just been published.&nbsp; It is the result
of much time and patient labor, and is a valuable contribution
toward a complete history of this extraordinary people.&nbsp; The
Gipsy race and the Gipsy language are subjects of much interest,
socially and ethnologically.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He estimates the
number of Gipsies in Great Britain at 250,000, and the whole
number in Europe and America at 4,000,000.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;The work is what it professes to be, a veritable
history&mdash;a history in which Gipsy life has been stripped of
everything pertaining to fiction, so that the reader will see
depicted in their true character this strange people . . .&nbsp;
And yet, these pages of sober history are crowded with facts and
incidents stranger and more thrilling than the wildest imaginings
of the romantic school.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>THE ENGLISH UNIVERSITIES AND JOHN BUNYAN, AND THE
ENCYCLOP&AElig;DIA BRITANNICA AND THE GIPSIES.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;In this pamphlet Mr. James Simson again does battle in
support of his contention that Bunyan was a Gipsy&mdash;a thesis
first promulgated by him in an elaborate work on the Gipsies,
published in 1865.&nbsp; He is indignant at Mr. Froude for
ignoring the discussion of the question in his recent biography
of Bunyan, and he comments in strong terms on the dicta of Mr.
Francis H. Groome, in the article &lsquo;Gipsies,&rsquo; in the
new edition of the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i>, that
John Bunyan does not appear to have had one drop of Gipsy
blood.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Simson&rsquo;s tractate
will be perused with deep interest by all students of the customs
and history of the Gipsies.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Edinburgh
Courant</i>, <i>November</i> 3, 1880.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this pamphlet Mr. James Simson, editor of
<i>Simson&rsquo;s History of the Gipsies</i>, states his grounds
for believing that John Bunyan was a Gipsy, and invokes the
assistance of the Universities to investigate the matter and put
it beyond the possibility of doubt.&nbsp; It may not matter much
whether or not the &lsquo;immortal dreamer&rsquo; was a Gipsy and
we do not think Mr. Simson attaches any great importance to the
circumstance <i>per se</i>.&nbsp; What he aims at, we believe, is
to stir up some interest in the Gipsy race, and this he thinks
may be done were the public to have their sympathies awakened by
the fact that John Bunyan was a descendant of it.&nbsp; By way of
supplement, Mr. Simson criticises some statements made in an
article in the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i>, on the
Gipsies.&nbsp; The curious in the subject of Gipsy lore will
doubtless find in the pamphlet matter that will interest
them.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Perthshire Advertiser</i>, <i>October</i>
28, 1880.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Simson suggests, and supports, on arguments that
have the highest bearing on anthropological questions, the theory
that John Bunyan was a Gipsy.&nbsp; The great secret that
civilised Europe has even now amongst it a few individuals who
are descended from a Hindoo race, and are capable, by reason of
the fact that they have a particularly original soul of their
own, to reconcile some of the difficulties between the eastern
and the western schools of thought, may be the real future fact
of modern anthropology.&nbsp; The difficulty is, of course, where
and how to find the Gipsies.&nbsp; We have been much pleased with
Mr. Simson&rsquo;s pamphlet.&nbsp; It is not every writer who has
treated the subject in his philosophical manner; and we are glad
to perceive that he strongly accents the fact that a person may
be a Gipsy and yet be entirely ignorant [not absolutely so] of
the Gipsy language.&nbsp; Evidently Mr. Simson has studied
anthropological problems at first hand, and apart from the
speculators who have regarded language as the first key to the
science of man.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Public Opinion</i>,
<i>October</i> 15, 1880.</p>
<h2>CHARLES WATERTON, <span class="smcap">Naturalist</span>.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;That Mr. Simson had a duty&mdash;to himself as well as
to the public&mdash;to perform in justifying his previous remarks
about Charles Waterton, by writing this monograph, is
unquestionable.&nbsp; Although it is a somewhat difficult task
unsparingly to point out the mistakes and shortcomings of a man,
when he can no longer defend himself, without seeming to be
guilty of an offence against the old rule&mdash;<i>Nil nisi bonum
de mortuis</i>&mdash;Mr. Simson may fairly claim credit for
having adhered to the Shakespearian advice in regard to
fault-finding; for, if he has extenuated nothing, he has set down
naught in malice.&nbsp; The example of Charles Waterton, country
gentleman and naturalist, may serve as a useful warning to
students of natural history, by teaching them that only the most
patient investigation and careful reflection can produce results
that will be of real and permanent value to science.&nbsp; They
have here the example of a man who had most excellent
opportunities for such investigations, as well as the strongest
taste for their pursuit, and who, by an exact and systematic
method of study, might have made most important additions to our
knowledge of natural history.&nbsp; But by inaccurate
observation, by a certain looseness of statement, and by taking
things for granted instead of personally verifying them, he has
greatly diminished the value of his labours.&nbsp; Mr. Simson,
though his task is to set right the unduly high estimate in which
the squire of Walton Hall has been held as a man of science,
shows an appreciation of the strong points of his character that
completely takes away any appearance of censoriousness; and his
work incidentally affords an interesting study of the man
himself, who, in his personal life and his enthusiastic devotion
to natural history, showed a strong individuality that is quite
refreshing in this age of
conventionalities.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Aberdeen Journal</i>,

<p>&ldquo;The principal articles in this volume that have
reference to natural history originally appeared in <i>Land and
Water</i>, and are, in many respects, highly interesting.&nbsp;
Concerning vipers and snakes, we are presented with a good deal
of information that is instructive, not only as regards their
habits generally, but also with respect to points that are in
dispute among naturalists.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;For instance, it
is a vexed question whether, under any circumstances, the young
retreat into the stomach [inside] of the mother snake.&nbsp; A
great authority, [?] Mr. Frank Buckland, affirms that they do
not; while our author is as positive that they do.&nbsp; And he
certainly, with reason, contends that the question is entirely
one of evidence, and, therefore, should be settled &lsquo;as a
fact is proved in a court of justice; difficulties, suppositions,
or theories not being allowed to form part of the
testimony.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;In support of his own
views, Mr. Simson has collected a large body of evidence that
undoubtedly appears authentic and conclusive.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Of the miscellaneous papers in this volume, the best is a
critical study of the late John Stuart Mill.&nbsp; Taken
altogether, the volume is very entertaining, and affords pleasing

interesting, though partaking largely of a controversial nature,
deal chiefly with questions affecting snakes and vipers.&nbsp; Of
the other Contributions, the most attractive and readable is the
one which contests some of Mr. Borrow&rsquo;s conclusions in his
well-known account of the Gipsies.&nbsp; Mr. John Stuart Mill
forms the subject of a slashing dissertation, which is not likely
to find much favour with the friends of the departed
philosopher.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Rochdale Observer, June 19,
1875.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The study of natural history has a peculiar charm for
most people, but for Lancashire folk it seems to have a special
interest.&nbsp; Perhaps the most striking feature of the book at
the head of this notice is the variety of topics touched upon, <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>topics which,
although apparently incompatible and incongruous, are,
nevertheless, both curious and interesting.&nbsp; The author
certainly brings a large amount of special knowledge to the
discussion of the questions he introduces, and the essays are
undoubtedly well written.&nbsp; Our readers will see that the
work is full of controversial matter, embracing natural history,
theology, and biography, and consequently will suit the taste of
those who like to enter into discussions which excite the
feelings, and in which abundance of energy and ability is
displayed.&nbsp; The book is certainly ably written, and the
author shows himself to be a man of large
accomplishments.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Liverpool Albion, June 18,
1875.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The articles are written in a very readable manner, and
will be found interesting even by those who have no special
knowledge of natural history or interest in it.&nbsp; The Gipsies
are competitors with the snakes for Mr. Simson&rsquo;s regards,
and several papers are devoted to these mysterious nomadic
tribes.&nbsp; Perhaps the most curious paper in the volume is
written to prove that John Bunyan was a Gipsy, and a very fair
case is certainly made out, principally from Bunyan&rsquo;s own
autobiographical statements.&nbsp; With the exception of the
papers on John Stuart Mill, to which we have already alluded, and
which are far worse than worthless, the book is one which we can
recommend.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Newcastle Courant, June 11,
1875.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bulk of these Contributions appeared in <i>Land and
Water</i>.&nbsp; We think the author has done well to give them
to the public in the more enduring form of a well got up
volume.&nbsp; The book contains, also, a critical sketch of the
career of John Stuart Mill; some gossip about Gipsies; and the
Duke of Argyll&rsquo;s notions about the preservation of the
Jews.&nbsp; Altogether, the book is very readable.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Northern Whig, June 17, 1875.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This volume consists of Contributions to <i>Land and
Water</i> by a writer well-known as the author [editor] of a
standard book on the Gipsies, and is evidently the production of
a clear, intelligent, and most observant mind.&nbsp; Mr. Simson
adds a number of miscellaneous papers, including a masterly,
though severe, criticism of John Stuart Mill&mdash;&lsquo;his
religion, his education, a crisis in his history, his wife, Mill
and son,&rsquo;&mdash;as well as several desultory papers on the
Gipsies, elicited, for the most part, by criticisms on his work
on that singular race.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Western Times, June 29, 1875.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The preface to this volume is dated from New York, and
the contents bear marks of the free, racy style of transatlantic
writers.&nbsp; The volume closes with a paper on the
&lsquo;Preservation of the Jews.&rsquo;&nbsp; The writer deals
with his several subjects with marked ability, and his essays
form a volume which will pay for reading, and therefore pay for
purchasing.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Daily Review, June 11, 1875.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need only mention the other subjects&mdash;Waterton
as a Naturalist, Romanism, John Stuart Mill, Simson&rsquo;s
History of the Gipsies, Borrow on the Gipsies, the Scottish
Churches and the Gipsies, Was John Bunyan a Gipsy? and, of
course, the literary ubiquitous Duke of Argyll on the
Preservation of the Jews.&nbsp; The only paper we have not
ventured to look at is the last, in the dread that on this
question the versatile Duke might be found, as in the matter of
the Scottish Church, verifying the French proverb&mdash;<i>Il va
chercher midi &agrave; quatorze heures</i>&mdash;a work in which
the author of this volume is an adept in quiet, quaint, and
clever ways, however, which make it interesting.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="footnote10a"></a><a href="#citation10a"
class="footnote">[10a]</a>&nbsp; <i>Contributions to Natural
History</i>, etc., p. 158.</p>
<p><a name="footnote10b"></a><a href="#citation10b"
class="footnote">[10b]</a>&nbsp; I have commented on the
assertion of Mr. Groome, that &ldquo;John Bunyan, from parish
registers, does not appear to have had one drop of Gipsy
blood,&rdquo; as if that could have been ascertained from parish
registers!&nbsp; I did not expect to find such a loose idea as
that in the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i>, taken from a
casual or stray contributor to <i>Notes and Queries</i>.&nbsp;
But I find an English journal quoting it as a <i>proof</i> that
Bunyan was not of the Gipsy race; and supporting it by Mr.
Froude&rsquo;s ignoring the question in his highly conventional
work on Bunyan.&mdash;<i>The Scottish Churches and the
Gipsies</i>, pp. 11, 52 and 59.</p>
<p><a name="footnote11a"></a><a href="#citation11a"
class="footnote">[11a]</a>&nbsp; Mr. Brown objects to its being
said that the English Bunyans could have sprung from Bunyans that
left Scotland fifty years before 1548, for the reason that he
finds men of that name in England, in 1219, 1257 and 1310.&nbsp;
Thomas Bunyan, if he is correct in his information, says that the
Italian mason of the name of Bunyan was at Melrose in 1136.&nbsp;
The name might have had its origin in foreign masons called
Bunyan, as there would be families of that craft, continued from
generation to generation, during the middle ages, employed in
church architecture all over Europe, including England as well as
Scotland.&nbsp; I have not seen Mr. Thomas Bunyan&rsquo;s
information, as quoted above, called in question by any one.</p>
<p><a name="footnote11b"></a><a href="#citation11b"
class="footnote">[11b]</a>&nbsp; Dated 6th September, 1882.</p>
<p><a name="footnote11c"></a><a href="#citation11c"
class="footnote">[11c]</a>&nbsp; In an article in <i>Notes and
Queries</i>, for the 27th March, 1875, I said:&mdash;&ldquo;In
addition to the investigations made in church registers, I would
suggest that the records of the different criminal courts in
Bedfordshire (if they still exist) should be examined, to find if
people of the name of Bunyan (and how designated) are found to
have been on trial, and for what
offences.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Contributions</i>, <i>etc.</i>, p.
186.</p>
<p><a name="footnote12"></a><a href="#citation12"
class="footnote">[12]</a>&nbsp; The language used by Bunyan in
describing who and what he was, was so comprehensive and graphic
that by using the word &ldquo;Gipsy&rdquo; he would have confused
his reader, for in that case he would have had to explain its
meaning as applicable to himself.&nbsp; This would have been
foreign to his subject, and, in the face of the legal
responsibility, would have compromised his personal safety, and
proved a bar to his usefulness, or standing in society, as
illustrated by the aversion on the part of so many to investigate
the idea to-day.&nbsp; He said that his &ldquo;descent was well
known to many.&rdquo;&nbsp; Did not that imply that he had been
more precise to <i>many in private</i>, but would not use a word
in his <i>Grace Abounding</i>?&nbsp; This heading was very
expressive when we consider that many would almost seem to think
that the &ldquo;Gipsy tribe,&rdquo; or those possessing Gipsy
blood, are outside of &ldquo;God&rsquo;s covenanted
mercies.&rdquo;&nbsp; According to Mr. Brown, Bunyan&rsquo;s
language, as we shall see, &ldquo;<i>might</i> simply mean that
his father was a poor man in a village!&rdquo; and that in
ascertaining who he was, &ldquo;I have really nothing to go upon
but Bunyan&rsquo;s own words&rdquo; about himself (which is not a
fact), as if these had no bearing on the question, and were not
worth listening to, and possessed no meaning!</p>
<p><a name="footnote13"></a><a href="#citation13"
class="footnote">[13]</a>&nbsp; Dated 8th September, 1882.</p>
<p><a name="footnote14a"></a><a href="#citation14a"
class="footnote">[14a]</a>&nbsp; Mr. Borrow, in his <i>Gipsies in
Spain</i>, gives a very graphic account of the result of a
marriage between a Spaniard and a Gipsy woman.&nbsp; I have
alluded to it, in the Disquisition on the Gipsies, as &ldquo;a
very fine illustration of this principle of half-breed ultra
Gipsyism,&rdquo; that of &ldquo;an officer in the Spanish army
adopting a young female Gipsy child, whose parents had been
executed, and educating and marrying her.&nbsp; A son of this
marriage, who rose to be a captain in the service of Donna
Isabel, hated the white race so intensely as, when a child, to
tell his father that he wished he (his father) was dead.&nbsp; At
whose door must the cause of such a feeling be laid? . . .&nbsp;
This is certainly an extreme instance of the result of the
prejudice against the Gipsy race; and no opinion can be formed
upon it without knowing some of the circumstances connected with
the feelings of the father, or his relations, toward the mother
and the Gipsy race generally&rdquo; (p. 372).</p>
<p><a name="footnote14b"></a><a href="#citation14b"
class="footnote">[14b]</a>&nbsp; This Thomas Bonyon might not
have been born till many years after 1502, as I have explained at
page 18.</p>
<p><a name="footnote15a"></a><a href="#citation15a"
class="footnote">[15a]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Easily explained,&rdquo;
indeed, by his father having been &ldquo;simply a poor man in a
village.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote15b"></a><a href="#citation15b"
class="footnote">[15b]</a>&nbsp; Mr. Brown in his letter
acknowledges having received these pamphlets.&nbsp; I did not
send them with the object of enlightening him on the subject
under review.&nbsp; I have not been able to see his book on the
Bunyan Festival.&nbsp; It is very likely that I would find matter
in it for comment.</p>
<p><a name="footnote16a"></a><a href="#citation16a"
class="footnote">[16a]</a>&nbsp; It reads very candidly when it
is said that &ldquo;none of Bunyan&rsquo;s admirers would object
to his being shown to be a Gipsy, if only sufficient proof were
adduced.&rdquo;&nbsp; The real position is, that Bunyan&rsquo;s
admissions as to what he was and was not, and his calling and
surroundings, show that he was of the Gipsy race; and
&ldquo;proof&rdquo; should be &ldquo;adduced&rdquo; to show that
he was <i>not</i> that, but of the <i>ordinary race</i> of
Englishmen.</p>
<p><a name="footnote16b"></a><a href="#citation16b"
class="footnote">[16b]</a>&nbsp; It would be interesting to learn
from Mr. Brown, 1<i>st</i>. When, and under what circumstances,
he took up this question in regard to Bunyan; <i>2d</i>. What
regard he paid to the subject of the Gipsies in general, as
published; 3<i>d</i>. Whether he made any personal inquiries in
regard to it; 4<i>th</i>. Whether he read anything, and what, in
favour of Bunyan having been of the Gipsy race; 5<i>th</i>. How
he came to maintain that because the name of Bunyan existed in
England before the Gipsies arrived in it, therefore Bunyan was
not one of the race; 6<i>th</i>. Whether he knows of Gipsies
bearing native surnames, and even of one with a foreign surname;
7<i>th</i>. What reason he had for supposing that Thomas Bonyon,
in 1542, had no Gipsy blood in his veins, or that his descendants
for several generations did not pass into the Gipsy current in
society, as explained; 8<i>th</i>. Where Mr. Brown resided before
he settled at Bedford, and how long he has been there.&nbsp;
9<i>th</i>. What traditions he found in the town and
neighbourhood bearing on Bunyan&rsquo;s descent, and whether
there are people there averse to its being asserted that Bunyan
was what might be called of the <i>ordinary native</i> English
race; 10<i>th</i>. Are there none there who object to its being
said that Bunyan&rsquo;s family was a broken-down branch of the
aristocracy, titled or untitled, that most probably entered
England from Normandy, under William the Conqueror?&nbsp;
11<i>th</i>. What are the reasons for saying that Bunyan was
<i>not</i> of the Gipsy race?&nbsp; 12<i>th</i>. Might not
<i>any</i> person be of the Gipsy race, notwithstanding it was
not even surmised, much less <i>proved</i>, by any one acquainted
with the Gipsy subject, and much more so by one apparently
totally ignorant of it?&nbsp; 13<i>th</i>. Since Bunyan was an
Englishman under any circumstances, why should anyone claim him
to have been entirely of the native or ordinary blood, till it is
proved that part of his blood belonged to the Gipsy race, that
entered Great Britain not later than 1506&mdash;no regard being
shown to what he said he &ldquo;was and was not, and his calling
and surroundings&rdquo;?&nbsp; 14<i>th</i>. Has Mr. Brown&rsquo;s
object, from first to last, been exclusively that of proving
Bunyan <i>not</i> to have been of the Gipsy race?&nbsp;
15<i>th</i>. In that case, should he not, while occupying the
pulpit of Bunyan, look upon his &ldquo;mission&rdquo; as most
sacred, and &ldquo;laying aside every weight and the sin which
doth so easily beset him,&rdquo; &ldquo;give no sleep to his eyes
or slumber to his eyelids&rdquo; till he was satisfied who Bunyan
really was, and acknowledge him accordingly?</p>
<p><a name="footnote17"></a><a href="#citation17"
class="footnote">[17]</a>&nbsp; Dated 13th September, 1882.</p>
<p><a name="footnote18"></a><a href="#citation18"
class="footnote">[18]</a>&nbsp; There may be some doubt that
Towla Bailyow, mentioned in a writ of the Scots&rsquo; parliament
in 1540, was a Baillie according to the modern spelling of the
word.&nbsp; In that case, the first Gipsies mentioned officially
in Great Britain with full native names, seem to have been John
Brown and George Brown, as found in a writ of the Scots&rsquo;
parliament of the 8th April, 1554.&nbsp; In the <i>History of the
Gipsies</i> I find the following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am further inclined to think that it
would be about this period, and chiefly in consequence of these
bloody enactments, the Gipsies would, in general, assume the
ordinary Christian and surnames common at that time in
Scotland.&nbsp; And their usual sagacity pointed out to them the
advantages arising from taking the cognomens of the most powerful
families in the kingdom, whose influence would afford them ample
protection as adopted members of their respective clans.&nbsp; In
support of my opinion of the origin of the surnames of the
Gipsies of the present day, we find that the most prevailing
names among them are those of the most influential of our noble
families of Scotland, such as Stewart, Gordon, Douglas, Graham,
Ruthven, Hamilton, Drummond, Kennedy, Cunningham, Montgomery,
Kerr, Campbell, Maxwell, Johnstone, Ogilvie, McDonald, Robertson,
Grant, Baillie, Shaw, Burnet, <i>Brown</i>, Keith,
etc.&rdquo;&nbsp; To that I added that &ldquo;the English Gipsies
say that native names were assumed by their race in consequence
of the proscription to which it was subjected.&rdquo;&mdash;(p.
117.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="footnote19"></a><a href="#citation19"
class="footnote">[19]</a>&nbsp; Perhaps I admitted too much when
I said that &ldquo;William Bonyon and his wife were apparently
ordinary English people,&rdquo; for they need not necessarily
have been that, as I have shown.&nbsp; Had they been such, the
tradition of it would soon have died out in their Gipsy
descendants of mixed blood but for the little property that
remained in the family; for the associations of descent from the
native race are not pleasant to the tribe when they consider the
hard feelings which it has entertained for their Gipsy blood.</p>
<p>James IV. of Scotland, when introducing &ldquo;Anthonius
Gawino, Earl of Little Egypt, and the other afflicted and
lamentable tribe of his retinue,&rdquo; to his uncle, the King of
Denmark, in 1506, said that they &ldquo;had lately arrived on the
frontiers of our kingdom&rdquo;; so that it is uncertain at what
time before 1506 some of the tribe had made their appearance
without being recorded in a public document.&nbsp; The Scottish
king believed that as &ldquo;Denmark was nearer to Egypt than
Scotland,&rdquo; a greater number of the Gipsies sojourned in it;
and that his uncle would know more about them than he did.&nbsp;
If this style of reasoning was correct, England must have
received Gipsies before Scotland, for it was &ldquo;nearer to
Egypt than Scotland.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>History of the Gipsies</i>,
p. 99.</p>
<p>Speaking of the &ldquo;standing&rdquo; of the leading Gipsies
in Scotland between 1506 and 1579, the author of the History
wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is evident that the Gipsies in Scotland
at that time were allowed to punish the criminal members of their
own tribe according to their own peculiar laws, customs and
usages, without molestation.&nbsp; And it cannot be supposed that
the ministers of three or four succeeding monarchs would have
suffered their sovereigns to be so much imposed on as to allow
them to put their names to public documents, styling poor and
miserable wretches, as we at the present day imagine them to have
been, &lsquo;Lords and Earls of Little Egypt.&rsquo; . . . I am
disposed to believe that Anthonius Gawino in 1506, and John Faw
in 1540, would personally as individuals, that is, as Gipsy
&lsquo;Rajahs,&rsquo; have a very respectable and imposing
appearance in the eyes of the officers of the Crown&rdquo; (p.
107).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although he says that &ldquo;the English government had not
been so easily nor so long imposed on as the kings of Scotland,
and the authorities of Europe generally&rdquo; (p. 91), we can
easily imagine that the principal Gipsies at least occupied a
pretty good position among the English people generally.&nbsp; If
Bailyow in 1540 represented the native name of Baillie (as it is
believed to have done), we could have William Bonyon, who died in
1542, one of the original Gipsies, most likely of mixed blood;
and we certainly had &ldquo;John Brown and George Brown,
Egyptians,&rdquo; before 1554.</p>

agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
